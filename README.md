# Ovatu PHP Code Test

This project contains a simple Yii 1.1 barebones application with the following components:

1. An SQLite database (all config setup), complete with example dataset.
2. Object models mapped to each table in the SQLite DB (including relations).
3. Basic site controller showing the full contents of the included DB.

## What we would like to see from you.

We would like you to showcase your software design experience by exposing this very simple dataset to a REST API.

1. We would like to see an endpoint to expose the beers table.
2. The endpoint should include an option to search as well as pagination.
3. We would like to see at last one write operation, what it does is up to you.
4. Authentication is not necessary, however if you felt inclined to showcase this, it would be interesting to see.
